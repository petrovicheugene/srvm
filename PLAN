1. Storing calibration to file and load calibration from file
2. Correlation in case fractional equation is not to concentration but to (Base/N)/C
3. Fractional equation settings: Normalization, Using Base term as an influence term
4. Recalculation calibration factors after a single change in calibration
5. Copy calibration or windows
6. Mixed and Custom terms
